# This script is used to manually upload data into rucio and update DB. It does:
# 1. Read the data names from the input directory.
# 2. Check if the rule exists in rucio. 
# 3. If yes, do admix upload with rundb update. 
#   3.1. If upload succeeds, record the uploaded dataname into the success log.
#   3.2. If upload fails, record the failed dataname and errors into the failed log.
# 4. If no, record the dataname into the existed data log.
# In the whole time, record the CPU usage and memory usage every 10 seconds, 
# and save them into a npy file.
